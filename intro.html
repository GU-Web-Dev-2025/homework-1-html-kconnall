<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I am an ambitious professional with a proven track record of pressing “remind me later” on software updates and remembering movie quotes
    better than peoples birthdays. My academic journey has armed me with an impressive collection of half-finished projects, creative Google searches, 
    and the ability to look very busy while secretly fixing the Wi-Fi. I have been recognized for achievements such as winning an argument with autocorrect,
    keeping a straight face on Zoom calls, and completing placements in “trying my best.” My core skills include multitasking (snacking while working), 
    problem-solving (mainly problems I created myself), and adaptability (I can nap just about anywhere). I am seeking opportunities to contribute my
    questionable expertise and world-class enthusiasm to any team that provides coffee.</p>
